There are many great GUI tools specifically tailored to make Java Development easier and more fun. The first ones that come to our mind are IDEs such as IntelliJ, VSCode or Eclipise. On the non GUI side, we find also great tools that imporve our DX (developer experience) 

As a terminal lover, let me share with you some CLI tools that'll make java development a breez.

## JDK version management

With Java releasing a new version each 6 months, having a propert JDK version management is a must. I recommand these two tools depending on your OS.

- On Windows: [scoop](https://scoop.sh/)
- On Linux and macOS: [SDKMAN!](https://sdkman.io/)

IN addition to providing commands that easily switvh between JDS versions, these tools also allow to install other Java related tools such as maven, gradle, Kotlin, etc.

## Creating general purpose projects

In this section, I recommend two tools to create and manage Java projects from the command line.

### JBang

This tool is one of the simplest and easiet ones to get started with Java. It allows to create self-contained source-only projects. It is thus particularly adapted for education or for small projects.

This tools can be install with `scoop install jbang` or `sdk install jbang`.

### Gradle

## Server-side development

- Spring boot
- Quarkus
- JEE with Open Liberty

## Front-end development

JavaFX
